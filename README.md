# OPS445 Lab-7 - Modules and Unit Testing

Welcome to OPS445 Lab 7!

In this lab, you will advance your Python programming skills by learning how to organize code into modules and validate functionality with unit testing. These practices are essential for writing professional, maintainable, and error-resistant programs.

📚 Lab Objectives:
+ Learn how to create and use Python modules
+ Import functions from modules to keep code organized and reusable
+ Understand the importance of unit testing in verifying program correctness
+ Write test cases to validate functions and catch errors early
+ Practice debugging by interpreting test results and fixing issues
+ Strengthen your ability to structure larger projects with modular design

📂 Lab Files:
You will create and work with the following files during this lab:
+ Creating and importing modules
+ Writing reusable functions in modules
+ Unit testing with 
+ Combining modules and unit tests
+ Output log from the checking script

🧩 Tips & Tricks:
+ Keep modules focused—each should group related functions logically.
+ Use descriptive names for both modules and functions to improve readability.
+ Write unit tests that cover both expected and unexpected inputs.
+ Run tests frequently to catch errors early in development.
+ Compare Python’s modular design with Bash scripting to appreciate differences in structure and maintainability.
